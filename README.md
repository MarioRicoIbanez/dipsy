## AI Project for Psychology: Emotion Detection with Transformer Architectures
## Description
This project aims to leverage the potential of Transformers in AI to enhance the field of psychology. Specifically, our purpose is to detect the emotions that patients express during their therapy sessions.

The project structure is based on several branches, an analysis with BERT structures, a data augmentation branch, and branches using the well-known meta-model, called Llama and Llama 2.

## Why This Project?
The accurate detection and understanding of a patient's emotions are crucial in psychology. However, emotions can be subtle, complex, and sometimes challenging to identify, even for the most experienced professionals. This project aims to assist in this process by harnessing the power of Transformers in natural language processing.
