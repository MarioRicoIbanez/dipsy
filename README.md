## AI-Enhanced Emotion Detection in Psychology

### Project Overview
PsyTrack, being integrated into [psytrack.es](psytrack.es), takes a pivotal stride into emotion detection utilizing the power of Transformer architectures in Artificial Intelligence, ensuring more robust and nuanced psychological analysis during therapy sessions. It establishes a bridge between advanced NLP techniques and practical applications in psychology, notably through emotion analysis.

### Project Genesis
#### Stage 1: Comprehensive Analysis of BERT-Based Models
A meticulous examination of the state of the art in emotion detection was undertaken with a focus on BERT-based models, including RoBERTa, BERT, and DeBERTa, using the ISEAR (International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions) dataset. The insights derived from this phase guided the subsequent application and development stages of the project.

#### Stage 2: Implementing Advanced Models
Leveraging _Llama 2_, a formidable model released by Meta, we achieved superior results compared to traditional BERT-based models due to its extensive knowledge and deep training. The code has been optimized for the NVIDIA A100 but is adaptable for use with a 3090.

### Data Augmentation Techniques
Data augmentation was executed using multiple approaches including:
- Deploying GPT-3.5 and Llama 2 for generating synthetic data.
- Incorporating data from alternative datasets while preserving the foundational ISEAR dataset.
